steganography vulnerablity scanner

The technique of hiding data in digital media
 through Steganography operates as a vital platform for safe
 communication among networks. The identical tool serves se
curity functions but raises substantial risks when used illegally
 for tasks like hidden communication and data removal or
 malicious software distribution. The proposed system serves as
 a Steganography Vulnerabilities Scanner to detect hiding data
 in media files by implementing rule-based analysis methods.
 The system departs from contemporary methods by using min
imalistic statistical and structural analysis approaches which
 incorporate entropy analysis combined with chi-square attack
 and histogram inspection and bit-plane analysis. This applica
tion provides universal file type support through its scanning
 capabilities which include images and audio and video formats
 and it enables operation through both command-line mode and
 optional graphical user interface. The proposed system delivers
 both effective and accessible anomaly detection at low operational
 cost which makes it appropriate for various resource-limited
 deployment scenarios.
